## Product Vision

Sprint 1: Create a website that shows a marketplace tab which contains a lot of offers for technologies subscriptions, infrastructure plans…etc.
Create a website that has a homepage that contains details about the company and details about the website and what it offers, in addition to a tab that navigates to marketplace page which contains list of offers for technologies, subscriptions, infrastructure plans, and other products. It also contains a search bar that allows the user to search for the desired products by their name. In addition, it contains a filter bar that allows the user to show only relevant results in the marketplace based on his choices like showing subscriptions only, infrastructure plans…etc. The user also will be allowed to register on the website using his personal information like email, password, username. The user also will be able to log into the website using his personal information, which will allow him to interact with the website based on his login credentials. The user will be able to add payment methods to his account securely and use them to complete purchases from the marketplace products.

Sprint 2: Create a feed page that shows feedbacks of users about technologies subscriptions for example, comparisons, and suggestions between the users. In addition, there will be a dashboard for sellers that will allow them to add items that will be shown in the marketplace page and, they will be able to see their selling charts and numbers. There will be a customer feedback page where the user will be able to contact support team for enquires and assistance. The users and sellers will also be able to customize their profiles. Finally, there will be a blog page where users can post technical articles like feedbacks, comparisons, tutorials…etc.
## Story Points Estimation Convention

1-> Very Small User Story
3-> Small User Story
5-> Medium User Story
8-> Large User Story
11-> Very Large User Story
15-> Extra Large User Story (needs to be broken into several tasks)

The sprint duration = 45 story points

## Ordering Product Backlog and Rationale

In the first sprint, we selected the homepage and logo to be the highest priority since they are the main component of our website, as it is the first page that the users will see when they open the website. Then, we selected the registration and logging in to be the following product backlog items in the priority in order to allow the user to log into the website and interact with its functionalities.  Then, coming to the main functionality of this sprint the user will be able to open the marketplace page which will allow him to explore several offers on infrastructures, subscription plans, technologies, and items as well, the user also will be able filter the results to show user selected tags like Items, or subscription plans…etc. Moving to the next PBI which is the searching functionality, it will allow the users to search for specific items using their title which will be shown in the marketplace page. The user will also be able to add payment methods to its profile like Visa, Mastercard…etc. Which will allow him to proceed in purchasing the products or subscribing to the plans, this functionality will enhance the user experience and boost its speed since the user will not have to proceed to the original sites of the products and purchase them from there. Finally, the checkout will be the last step of the purchasing since it will generate a final receipt to the user showing him the final cost that will be needed to complete the purchase. The PBI are prioritized according to their added business value, the rest of the PBI are expected to be in the second sprint, since they have less business value than the first PBIs in the product backlog.
